I am a Stein Fellow in the Stanford Department of Statistics, where I work on problems related to high-dimensional regression, dimensionality reduction, graph-based nonparametric estimation and hypothesis testing, and selective inference. Previously, I obtained my PhD in Statistics from Carnegie Mellon University, where my thesis was awarded the Umesh K. Gavaskar Memorial Thesis Award. During my PhD, I also participated in COVID-19 forecasting efforts as a core member of the DELPHI group.
