Currently I am a Stein Fellow in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University.

Previously, I received my PhD from the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Ryan Tibshirani and Sivaraman Balakrishnan. My thesis was on "Statistical Guarantees for Spectral Methods on Neighborhood Graphs". My interests are in graph-based inference, minimax theory,
and the intersection between the two. During my PhD I also studied inference for network-valued data, and worked on COVID-19 forecasting as part of the
Delphi group.
