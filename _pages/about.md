I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University,
working with Ryan Tibshirani and Sivaraman Balakrishnan on problems related to nonparametric testing and regression
with graph-based total variation regularization. My interests are in graph-based inference, minimax theory,
and the intersection between the two.

In Summer of 2021, I received my PhD from the Statistics Department at CMU, advised
by Ryan and Siva. My thesis was on "Statistical Guarantees for Spectral Methods on Neighborhood Graphs". 
During my PhD I also studied inference for network-valued data, and worked on COVID-19 forecasting as part of the
Delphi group.
